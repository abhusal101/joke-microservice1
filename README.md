This works so far with JOKE CENTRAL
1. Nodejs Server Application - including webUI and backend (app.js)
2. MySQL - database that uses init.sql to initialise the initial schema
3. ETL - node etl application server, consumer and producer using RabbitMQ

ALL of this works locally at the moment.
I still need to implement submit joke and moderate joke
